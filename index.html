			Chicken
		</div>
		<p>
			The chicken in this recipe is absolutely fabulous and delicious. My biggest complaint is that the vegetables burnt to a crisp and were completely charred by the time the cooking was done. The lemons had practically disintegrated. If I make this again, I would probably add the vegetables about half way through. </p>

			Beef
		</div>
		<p>
			The Beef in this recipe is very nice and tasty. This is one of the specials here in this diner. It is served with grilled cheese and tomatos with some red wine.
